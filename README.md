# Principia Android Dependency Buildscripts
Scripts to build Principia Android dependencies.

Forked off of [Minetest's Android dependency buildscripts](https://github.com/minetest/minetest_android_deps).

## Usage
Generally you would use the prebuilt static libraries generated by Github Actions, which will get downloaded by Gradle. (TODO)

However if you're adding new dependencies, updating existing ones, or are building the dependencies locally you can manually run the build script, `./build.sh <target> <architecture>`. Keep in mind you will need the location to the Android NDK in the ANDROID_NDK env variable (e.g. /opt/android-sdk/ndk/21.4.7075529/`).

The architecture can be either `armeabi-v7a` (32-bit ARM), `arm64-v8a` (64-bit ARM), `x86` or `x86_64` (TODO). Target can be either a specific dependency (see `scripts/`) or `--all` to build all dependencies.
